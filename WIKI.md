## Step 1: Raw Read Quality Control (QC)
Perform initial quality assessment of raw sequencing reads.

## Step 2: Read Trimming and Filtering
Remove low-quality bases and adapter sequences to clean the reads.

## Step 3: Alignment to Reference Genome
Map the processed reads to a reference genome.

## Step 4: Alignment Processing and Quality Check
Refine alignments and evaluate their quality metrics.

## Step 5: Primer Trimming
Trim primer sequences from aligned reads to avoid biases.

## Step 6: Variant Calling
Identify genetic variants present in the sample.

## Step 7: Consensus Genome Generation
Assemble a consensus genome from called variants.

## Step 8: Clade and Lineage Assignment
Assign clade and lineage designations to the consensus genome.
